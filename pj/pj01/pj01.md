## Assignment Description

Your goal is to implement a simple, concurrent server implements the HTTP/1.1
protocol outlined in [RFC 1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945),
[RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616), and
Chapter 2 of Kurose & Ross (6e). 
For this assignment, you should implement
HTTP with non-persistent connections. 
You only need to support `GET` requests.
You do not need to support `POST` requests or cookies. 

For the purposes of this assignment, you may assume valid HTTP request messages 
as produced by major browsers (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, etc.). 

Only `.html`, `.txt`, and `.png` files from the server root directory (and subpaths) 
should be served by your HTTP server. 
By default, the server root should be a subdirectory called `www`.
The user running your server code should be able to override this default to
some other `path` using the `--root path` command-line argument. 
See the [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module for
a convenient method to parsing command-line arguments.
The default index page should be `index.html` or `index.txt`, with precedence 
taken in that order if both exist.

At a minimum, your server should support the following subset of generally recognized 
status codes:

* `200` - OK
* `400` - Bad Request
* `403` - Forbidden
* `404` - Not Found

For this assignment, we will test your server implementation using the 
`firefox` and `lynx` programs on Nike. 
Remember, you should only run server code on the `cf`/`vcf` cluster, and you 
should only use your assigned ports.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. 

1. **Server Code (80 points):** Implement a simple HTTP server that 
   follows the protocol described in RFC 1945 and Kurose & Ross.

   * **Good GET Requests (60 points):** Simple `GET` requests for `.txt` and `.html`
     files in the `www` subdirectory work as intended and produce the correct 
     status.

   * **Bad GET Requests (15 points):** In situations where a `400`, `403`, or `404` 
     status is appropriate, your server works as intended.

   * **Default Index (5 points):** In situations where a path for a `GET` request
     ends with a directory, a response containing the default index page, if it exists, 
     should be sent to the client. 

2. **Concurrency (20 points):** Support multiple client connections concurrently. 
   For this assignment, a client should not have to wait until another client is
   done before being served their response.

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (50 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `pj01`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

  Additionally, you should place the main part of your server code in a file
  called `web_server.py`.

* **Libraries (50 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module to implement any
  networking related code. 

* **Docstring Documentation (10 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (10 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `pj01`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 

```
$ submit pj01 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.
