## Assignment Description

Your goal is to write some code that can parse and display DNS Resource Records
(RRs) in a similar fashion to `dig(1)` by manually parsing a record's byte
string. You should familiarize yourself with the output produced by `dig(1)` 
to understand what is expected in terms of output. In this assignment, the byte
strings will be provided for you. This means that you will not need to write any
socket-related code (that will come later `;)`). 

The format for a DNS message is documented in section 4 of 
[RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035). A standard query response usually
contains both the query question and the query answer. This will make more sense
after you read the RFC. 

You may find the [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) module
useful for parsing (or *unpacking*) down to the byte level. If you need to 
interpret the byte string at a finer granularity, then bitwise operators will be
needed.

For this assignment, we will test your program by supplying different byte strings
for parsing. Some of them will be taken from the set of string provided with the
assignment and others will be taken from a secret stash. Byte strings from the
secret stash will be made available after the assignment has been graded. For
the purposes of this assignment, you may assume that files containing valid 
byte strings will be supplied to your program.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. 

1. **Main Program (40 points):** Assuming you implement the main part of your 
   program in `dns_parse.py`, you need to support reading in resource records
   from files using a command-line argument. For example, if an RR is stored
   `test/google.com.A.RR.bin`, then you should be able to parse and display the 
   record by typing something similar to the following:

   ```
   $ python3 dns_parse.py test/google.com.A.RR.bin
   ```
   See the [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module
   for convenient method for parsing command-line arguments. You may also find
   the [Reading and Writing Files](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files)
   tutorial provided by the Python 3 documentation helpful for this assignment.

   The test files for this assignment are contained in the [`test`](test/)
   directory. They should be opened for reading in binary mode.

2. **Support for `A` type Resource Records (20):** You should be able to parse
   and display, in a similar fashion to `dig(1)`, a byte string representing an
   `A` type resource record. In addition to understanding the top level format
   for RRs, as described in Section 3.2.1 of RFC 1035, you should also see 
   Section 3.4.1 for a detailed description of the `RDATA` format for an `A` 
   record.

3. **Support for `NS` type Resource Records (20):** You should be able to parse
   and display, in a similar fashion to `dig(1)`, a byte string representing an 
   `NS` type resource record. In addition to understanding the top level format
   for RRs, as described in Section 3.2.1 of RFC 1035, you should also see 
   Section 3.3.11 for a detailed description of the `RDATA` format for an `NS` 
   record.

4. **Support for `CNAME` type Resource Records (20):** You should be able to parse
   and display, in a similar fashion to `dig(1)`, a byte string representing a 
   `CNAME` type resource record. In addition to understanding the top level format
   for RRs, as described in Section 3.2.1 of RFC 1035, you should also see 
   Section 3.3.1 for a detailed description of the `RDATA` format for a `CNAME` 
   record.

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (50 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `hw02`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

  Additionally, you should place your main program code in `dns_parse.py`.

* **Libraries (50 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module, if needed, to 
  implement any networking related code. 

* **Docstring Documentation (10 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (10 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `hw02`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 
```
$ submit hw02 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.

## Using `dig(1)`

In order to test your program, you should compare its output to that of 
`dig(1)`. For example, if you are testing your program to make sure that it
works with the provided `google.com.A.RR.bin` test file, then you might compare
your program's output to the output produced by the following:
```
$ dig @8.8.8.8 -t A google.com
```
Or, if you were testing with the `uga.edu.NS.RR.bin` test file, then you might
compare with the output of the following:
```
$ dig @8.8.8.8 -t NS uga.edu
```
The RRs contained in the test files and the ones received by `dig(1)` after
performing an actual DNS query may not be identical. However, they should be
similar enough for testing purposes. 

In the `dig(1)` examples above, the `@8.8.8.8` is telling `dig` to query the
DNS server at IP address `8.8.8.8`, which just happens to be one of Google's 
public DNS servers. Please see the manual page for `dig(1)` for more information
about its command-line options.
