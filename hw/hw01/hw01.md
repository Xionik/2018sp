## Academic Honesty

You agree to the Academic Honesty policy as outlined in the course syllabus, 
course website, and your team application. Furthermore, you must adhere to
the copyright notice and licensing information at the bottom of this document.

## Assignment Description

Your goal is to implement a "knock knock" joke server that follows the simple
`KNOCK-KNOCK` protocol. When a client connects to the server, they should
immediately be greeted with the message `KNOCK KNOCK`. If the client responds
with anything other than `WHO'S THERE?`, then start over. When the client
responds with `WHO'S THERE?`, the server will respond with the first part of
a knock knock joke. Let's assume the server responded with `LETTUCE`. The user 
would then reply with `LETTUCE WHO?`. The server might then respond with 
`LETTUCE IN, IT'S COLD IN HERE` and terminate the connection with the client. 

For the purposes of this assignment, you may assume valid replies from the
client after they reply with `WHO'S THERE?`.

The protocol described above is case sensitive, and it always all upper case.

For this assignment, we will test your server implementation using the 
`telnet` program on Nike. Remember, you should only run server code on the 
`cf`/`vcf` cluster, and you should only use your assignment ports.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. 

1. **Server Code (60 points):** Implement a "knock knock" server that 
   follows the `KNOCK KNOCK` protocol described above.

2. **Joke Support (20 points):** Support at least ten (10) different 
   knock knock jokes. At least two (2) of them need to involve two (2) or more 
   words in response to `WHO'S THERE?`. You should document your jokes 
   in your `README.md` file.

3. **Concurrency (20 points):** Support multiple client connections concurrently. 
   For this assignment, a client should not have to wait until another client is
   done before being served their joke.

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (50 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `hw03`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

  Additionally, you should place your server code in `knock_knock_server.py`.

* **Attribution (10 points):** Proper attribution should be given for all jokes.
  You should put these in your `README.md` file.

* **Docstring Documentation (10 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (10 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `hw01`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 

```
$ submit hw01 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.
